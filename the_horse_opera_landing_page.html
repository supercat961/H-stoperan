  <h1>The Horse Opera</h1>
  <p>A new interdisciplinary opera created for a riding hall, exploring the relationship between human and horse through music, dance, and poetic storytelling.</p>

  <h2>About the Project</h2>
  <p class="meta">Premiere: August 28, 2026 · Orlången Riding Hall, Huddinge (Sweden)</p>
  <p>
    The Horse Opera is a newly written opera created by composer Arvid Kraft in collaboration with choreographer and director Alica Tserkovnaja and playwright Anna Nygren. The work brings together experimental live electronic music, somatic choreography, and a lyrical narrative in an intimate yet monumental operatic form.
  </p>
  <p>
    The opera is conceived specifically for performance inside a riding hall, allowing the architecture, acoustics, and proximity to horses to become part of the musical and dramatic experience.

  <h2>The Story</h2>
  <p>
    In a dystopian world where nature has been displaced, twins Jackie and Candy are born into a noble family. Jackie is human. Candy is a horse human hybrid. As adolescents, they flee their father’s control and escape to a magical school in the distant horse land of Equestria.
  </p>
  <p>
    Their bond is tested when Jackie falls in love with her classmate Jules. A desperate attempt to escape leads to a devastating fire, in which Candy sacrifices herself to save her sister. The opera concludes with a final aria in which Jackie mourns Candy’s death.
  </p>

  <h2>Music and Form</h2>
  <p>
    The score is written for a spatial loudspeaker orchestra, prepared piano, two sopranos, choir, and one dancer. Sound moves through the space in close dialogue with movement and text, creating an immersive listening experience that shifts between intimacy and intensity.
  </p>
  <p>
    Music, choreography, and libretto are developed together through workshop based processes, allowing each discipline to shape the others throughout the creation of the work.
